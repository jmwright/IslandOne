# IslandOne

## Introduction

IslandOne is designed as an interactive simulation based on the mathematics and systems proposed in the final report produced by NASA entitled [Growth Adapted Tensegrity Structures - A New Calculus for the Space Economy](https://www.nasa.gov/content/growth-adapted-tensegrity-structures-a-new-calculus-for-the-space-economy). There are two broad components of the project at this time.
1. Code infrastructure to allow mathematical analysis of the IslandOne tensegrity torus.
2. A 3D environment (standard and VR) that can be explored by a user.

1. [Growth Adapted Tensegrity Structures - A New Calculus for the Space Economy](https://www.nasa.gov/content/growth-adapted-tensegrity-structures-a-new-calculus-for-the-space-economy) - IslandOne is designed to be an interactive simulation based on the mathematics and systems proposed in the final report of this research.
2. [The High Frontier: Human Colonies in Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_High_Frontier:_Human_Colonies_in_Space) - The book that inspired the research and discovery of resource #1, and the creation of this project. It is also where the name _IslandOne_ comes from. However, it should be noted that the space station bearing the name _Island One_ in the book is spherical in shape not toroidal.
3. [Space Settlements](https://space.nss.org/settlement/nasa/75SummerStudy/Design.html) - A study done by NASA in conjunction with Stanford Univeristy where the Standford Torus space station design was proposed. The Growth Adapted Tensegrity Structures concept builds upon and arguably improves that space station design.
